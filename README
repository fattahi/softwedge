softwedge: A serial software keyboard wedge for *nix X11
	   (c) 2007 Yann Ramin <atrus@stackworks.net>
---------------------------------------------------------

softwedge is a small Linux utility which forwards data from a serial
port (such as from a tty, or a barcode scanner) and re-issues the data
as X11 key press events.

softwedge was designed to allow ordinary applications to accept data
from a Bluetooth barcode scanner (for testing, the author used a
Metrologic FocusBT, though any *decoded* serial or Bluetooth barcode
scanner should work).  Un-decoded scanners won't work - softwedge
expects input near the US-ASCII character-set, though not all control
codes work at this time.

Build status:

https://travis-ci.org/theatrus/softwedge.svg?branch=master


Quick start:
------------

make
make install

(If serial port is /dev/rfcomm0)
softwedge
(or)
softwedge -c /dev/ttyWhatever

Options:
--------

-c:
	Sets serial port 
-f:
	Run in the foreground - don't fork
-v:
	See version information

-h:
	Help text


Limitations:
------------

- Softwedge can't set any serial port parameters - use
  stty

- No support of input cleanup is supported	
  (extra LF removal, etc)
- Not all escape codes will directly transfer to X11 input at this time.
  I.e., FedEx PDF417 codes, UPS MaxiCode
- International barcode character sets are untested (i.e. QR Code)

Future:
-------

- Multiple input methods to allow for more international control
  i.e. text to clipboard
- Testing of more control codes
- Support of more Barcode specific features 
  	  - FocusBT encryption support, 2-way support
- GUI config tool
- and more...
